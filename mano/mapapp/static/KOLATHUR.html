            Kolathur, a bustling suburb in Chennai, traces its roots back to ancient times, with its name derived from the Tamil words "Kola Thoppu," meaning "the grove of jackfruit trees." Historically, it was part of the Chola Empire and later the Vijayanagara Kingdom. In the colonial era, it fell under British administration. Post-independence, Kolathur experienced rapid urbanization, transforming from agricultural land to a vibrant residential and commercial hub. Today, it boasts of diverse communities, modern amenities, and easy connectivity, making it a sought-after locality in Chennai.
